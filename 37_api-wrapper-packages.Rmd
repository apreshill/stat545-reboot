# Install-and-play {#api-wrappers}

Many common web services and APIs have been "wrapped", i.e. R functions have been written around them which send your query to the server and format the response.

Why do we want this?

* provenance
* reproducible
* updating
* ease
* scaling


## Searching the Public Library of Science using `rplos`

**Planning to switch out this example for another**

PLOS ONE is an open-access journal. They allow access to an impressive range of search tools, and allow you to obtain the full text of their articles. 

```{r}
# install.packages("rplos")
library(rplos)
```


### Searching PLOS

Let's do some searches:
```{r}
searchplos(q = "Helianthus", fl = "id", limit = 5)
```

```{r}
searchplos("materials_and_methods:France", 
           fl = "title, materials_and_methods")
```


### Plots over time

```{r}
plot_throughtime(terms = "phylogeny", limit = 200)
```
