# Using an API to get data {#use-api}

## Click-and-Download

In the simplest case, the data you need is already on the internet in a tabular format. There are a couple of strategies here:

* use `read.csv` or `readr::read_csv` to read the data straight into R.

* use the command line program `curl` to do that work, and place it in a Makefile or shell script (see the Make lesson for how to do that).

The second case is most useful when the data you want has been provided in a format that needs cleanup. For example, if the data you are interested in is available as Excel sheets, the safest option in this case is to download the `.xls` file and then read it into R with `readxl::read_excel()` or something similar. An exception to this is data provided as Google Spreadsheets, which can be read straight into R using the [`googlesheets`](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets) package.


### Example

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
```


## Install-and-play {#api-wrappers}

Many common web services and APIs have been "wrapped", i.e. R functions have been written around them which send your query to the server and format the response.

Why do we want this?

* provenance
* reproducible
* updating
* ease
* scaling


### Searching the Public Library of Science using `rplos`

**Planning to switch out this example for another**

PLOS ONE is an open-access journal. They allow access to an impressive range of search tools, and allow you to obtain the full text of their articles. 

```{r}
# install.packages("rplos")
library(rplos)
```


#### Searching PLOS

Let's do some searches:
```{r}
searchplos(q = "Helianthus", fl = "id", limit = 5)
```

```{r}
searchplos("materials_and_methods:France", 
           fl = "title, materials_and_methods")
```


#### Plots over time

```{r}
plot_throughtime(terms = "phylogeny", limit = 200)
```


## Interact with an API

Earlier we experimented with several packages that "wrapped" APIs. That is, they handled the creation of the request and the formatting of the output. Now we're going to look at (part of) what these functions were doing.

First we're going to examine the structure of API requests via the [Open Movie Database](https://www.omdbapi.com/) (OMDb). OMDb is very similar to IMDB, except it has a nice, simple API. We can go to the website, input some search parameters, and obtain both the XML query and the response from it.

## Setting API keys

Using the package `censusapi`
```{r warning = FALSE}
# install.packages("censusapi")
library(censusapi)
```


Request a new API key [here](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html). Check your email to activitate the key.

Now put your API key in your .Renviron file using `usethis`.

```r
library(usethis)

usethis::edit_r_environ() # edit your user level .Renviron
# OR
usethis::edit_r_environ("profile") # edit your project level .Renviron
```

Add "CENSUS_API_KEY=<your-api-key>" on a new line. Be sure to add a new line after this! <insert photo of RStudio default setting here> 


Save the file and restart your R session. If you are using Github be sure to add `.Renviron` to your `.gitignore` file so you don't accidentally push the key that you just took the time to hide. (or is this only the case if using a project + edit_r_environ("profile")?)


Now you can access your key with `Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY")`

Example
```{r}
my_secret <- function() {
  val <- Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY")
  if (identical(val, "")) {
    stop("`CENSUS_API_KEY` env var has not been set")
  }
  val
}

api_key <- my_secret()

getCensus(name = "dec/sf1", vintage = 2010, vars = c("NAME","P001001"), region = "block:*", 
          regionin = "state:36+county:027+tract:010000", key = api_key) %>% 
  head()
```
