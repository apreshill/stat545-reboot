There are many ways to obtain data from the Internet; let's consider four categories:

1. **Click-and-download**: get data from the internet as a "flat" file, such as a .csv, .xls
2. **Install-and-play**: get data from an API using an API-specific R package (a.k.a. an API client or an API wrapper) to do most of the heavy lifting (i.e. format the query, send the query to the API, get the response, etc.)
3. **Query an API**: get data from an API and *you* do most of the heavy lifting (i.e. interact with the API directly)
4. **Web-Scraping**: collect implicit data in an html website
