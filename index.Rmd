# Welcome to STAT 545 {-}

```{r include = FALSE}
source("common.R")
htmltools::tagList(rmarkdown::html_dependency_font_awesome())
library(tidyverse)
library(devtools)
library(DT)
```

Learn how to:

* explore, groom, visualize, and analyze data
* make all of that reproducible, reusable, and shareable
* using R

This is a bookdown version of STAT 545 @ University of British Columbia, a course in data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R. 

> "The STAT 545 course became notable as an early example of a data science course taught in a statistics program. It is also notable for its focus on teaching using modern R packages, Git and GitHub, its extensive sharing of teaching materials openly online, and its strong emphasis on practical data cleaning, exploration, and visualization skills, rather than algorithms and theory."

The contents of this book came from the [original STAT 545 website](https://STAT545-UBC.github.io/STAT545-UBC.github.io/), which is created by [this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io). 

## Colophon {-}

This book was written in [bookdown](http://bookdown.org/) inside [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/). The [website](https://stat545-book.netlify.com) is hosted with [netlify](https://www.netlify.com), and automatically updated after every commit by [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org). The complete source is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/rstudio-education/stat545).

The [STAT 545 logo](assets/stat545-logo.png) and the book style was designed by [Desir√©e De Leon](https://desiree.rbind.io/).


This version of the book was built with:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# needed because new_session is set to true in _bookdown.yml
all_pkgs <- renv::dependencies(path = "DESCRIPTION") %>% 
  pull(Package) 

session <- devtools::session_info(pkgs = all_pkgs)

session$platform
```

Along with these packages:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
session$packages %>% 
  select(package, loadedversion, date, source) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE,
                class = 'cell-border stripe',
                filter = list(position = 'top'),
                options = list(pageLength = nrow(session$packages), 
                           autoWidth = TRUE,
                           bInfo = FALSE,
                           paging = FALSE))
```
